TES-Pulse-Sim
=============

Pulse simulation via numerical solving of the TES differential equations

Follows equations given in Cabrera - Design considerations for TES and QET sensors.

Files:

PulseSimIntegrate4K.py - simulates a single photon and plots

PulseSimIntegrate.py - simulates many photons, saves in a pickle file

photonSimPlot.py - loads pickle file and plots
